# OS Lab Project

A web based application which "simulates" 4 types of CPU/Process scheduling algorithms in the backend and returns the result to the client.

The algorithms implemented are:

- `FCFS` (First Come First Serve)
- `SJF Preemptive` (Shortest Job First)
- `SJF Non Preemptive`
- `RR` (Round-Robin Scheduling)
